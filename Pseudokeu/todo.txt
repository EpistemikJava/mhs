    DONE
    ----
  1. +  Fix methods so REPLACING values for squares works properly - i.e. unsets the previous value.
  
  2. +  Subclass Group to Row, Col, Zone and use parent methods for Row, Col, but new sub-class methods for Zone.
  
  3. +  Add debugging framework to print out different categories of information,
        e.g. only method names to build a method call list.
  
  4. +  Amalgamate the Square methods: setMyCol, setMyRow, setMyZone to ? setGroups( c, r, z ) ? or similar.
  
  5. +  Have checkGrid write a message to Label indicating "OK" or problem.
  
  6. +- Multi-thread: so far just have loading Games in a separate thread...
  
  7. +  Create a pseudokeu.Logger Class to centralize all logging activity.
   	 +	Create special pseudokeu Buffer to store log info as preferred >> field of PskLogger
  	 +	Create special pseudokeu.Formatter Class to format logs as preferred.
  
  8.    ?? Use exceptions, e.g. IllegalSquareValueException where appropriate.
  
  9. +  Add indicator widget for "CHECK" function to show while processing.
 
 10. +  Fix background of top and bottom button panels to match grid panel.
 
 11. +  Fix PREFERRED_SIZE to use GAME_WIDTH & GAME_HEIGHT parameters
        and then use these to calculate xBorder & yBorder for grid centering.
 
 12. +  Add initFrame() method to Launcher to set frame size, background, etc 
        & call in Constructor before initComponents()
 
 13.    ?? Add Square[] myGroupSquares to each Square and set on initialization - use when setting/replacing values.
           Do Not Need the 2dArray of Squares?
           - replace with a 1d Squares array or just create and access via the Groups?
 
 14. +  Fix activeSqr hilite to turn off when cursor is out of Grid and Active state is OFF.
 
 15. +  Add actual file name to fields of SavedGame and display when loaded.
 
 16.    ?? Add more parameters to control logging, e.g. SET_VALUE_CHAIN_LOG_LEVEL.
        ?? Use a separate logger for Grid or Loader.
 
 17.    Externalize strings.
 
 18. +  Add method setGridKeymap() to Launcher which sets action keys for the buttons then calls setGridDebugKeymap()
 
 19. +  Investigate if calling Launcher.repaint() too much and can replace with Grid.repaint() in places.
        >> CANNOT USE Grid.repaint() -- it does NOT display the proper Grid font !!
           -- use Grid.paintComponent() instead and this seems to work.
     -  >> STILL may be a more efficient way to organize the calls to Launcher.repaint()...
 
 20.    Change log calls from a set level, e.g. fine, to a custom one based on the method.
        For example, 'setValueChainLogging', for methods in the 'set value chain', so this can be set
        to a particular level when needed, by a debug command, independent of other methods.
 
 21. +  Enable Undo/Redo.
 
 22. +- ENABLE SOLVE. Need: indicator widget, Timer, Pause enabled, etc.
        >> IMPROVE SOLVING TO FUNCTION EFFICIENTLY AND SAVE RESULTS OF FINDING PAIRS, TRIPLES, QUADS, WINGS, ETC.
 
 23. +  Need a help menu with explanation of using Alt key, etc.
 
 24. +  Alt + keypad numbers is intercepted by the Windows charmap function... try Shift instead.
        >> FIXED so Alt+Numpad works
 
 25. +  Add Alt + mnemonic letter for Menu titles (Game, Settings & Help).
 
 26. +  Create an 'Add Game' feature - add values to an empty grid then save to a file/jarfile
        >> Automatically keep track of and forbid any problem values.
 
 27. +  'Select Game' ComboBox is getting too long as more SavedGames are added - change to a spinner
        where user can directly enter the number of the game to load.
 
 28. +  Change load game to search a given directory and check/load any files found, of whatever filename,
        then check for gameXXX entries in a jar file.
 
 29. +  Games of different difficulties (easy,moderate,hard,very hard,insane) are stored in separate SavedGame arrays.
        User chooses the current level of difficulty from a pop-up frame.
 
 30.    ?? Display Group sqrsCanBeVal in Squares as temp values.
